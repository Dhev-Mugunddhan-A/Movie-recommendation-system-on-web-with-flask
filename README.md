<p>First download all the files in your system and follow the directory layout for storing the files.
  <br>
Name a folder flaskr in your project directory and store your "__init__.py" file.
  <br>
Store the "model.py" file in your project directory"
<br>
Create two other folder named static and templates. 
  <br>
Store the "style.css" in static folder
  <br>
Store the "login.html","index.html","success.html" files in the templates directory
  <br>
Once you are done with your directory structure, its time to run the file
<br>
  Run the model.py file separately in an IDE or command prompt terminal. 
  <br>
Now open your project directory i.e the directory above the flaskr folder in the command prompt terminal.
  <br>
And run the below command now in terminal,
  <br>
flask --app flaskr run --debug
  <br>
Then the program should be running successfully and the link for the webpage where the program is hosted will shown as output in terminal and you could access the webpage by running that output link in any of your web browser. </p>

<p>Note: The above program uses PostgresSQL server for database connetion, if you are using mysql edit the code in "__init__.py" to support mysql connection.</p>
