First download all the files in your system and follow the directory layout for storing the files. 
Name a folder flaskr in your project directory and store your "__init__.py" file. 
Create two other folder named static and templates. 
Store the "style.css" in static folder
Store the "login.html","index.html","success.html" files in the templates directory
Once you are done with your directory structure, its time to run the file
Now open your project directory i.e the directory above the flaskr folder in the command prompt terminal. 
And run the below command now in terminal,
flask --app flaskr run --debug
Then the program should be running successfully and the link for the webpage where the program is hosted will shown as output in terminal and you could access the webpage by running that output link in any of your web browser. 

Note: The above program uses PostgresSQL server for database connetion, if you are using mysql edit the code in "__init__.py" to support mysql connection.
